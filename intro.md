# The Time-Traveling Student

It was supposed to be just another ordinary day on campus.

Between half-finished assignments, overpriced coffee, and the pressure of exams looming, you weren’t exactly expecting adventure. But that changed when you stumbled upon a strange antique shop tucked between the bookstore and the old science building — a place you swear wasn’t there yesterday.

Inside, buried under layers of dust and forgotten trinkets, you found it:  
A beautifully intricate **pocket watch**, its glass glowing faintly with a pulse like a heartbeat. 

The shopkeeper said only one thing before disappearing into the back:  
_"Time is a choice."_

Back in your dorm, curiosity got the better of you. You wound the watch once... and suddenly, the world around you shattered like glass. You’re standing in a swirling tunnel of colors, time itself spinning in every direction. The watch vibrates in your hand. You can feel it asking you:

**Where — or *when* — do you want to go?**
