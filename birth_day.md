Title: The First Day

You press the watch, and the world tilts around you. Everything dissolves into a soft golden light, and when your vision clears, you're standing in front of a quiet hospital. The air smells crisp, the trees are smaller, and everything feels strangely... familiar.

You glance at a newspaper through the window of a corner store: it's your birthday—your actual birth day.

Inside the hospital, time moves slower. Nurses rush past in pastel scrubs, and the waiting room is filled with hushed voices and anxious smiles. You spot your father pacing nervously, glancing at the double doors every few seconds. He looks younger, his hair fuller, his face tense and excited. Your mother is nowhere to be seen—she's behind those doors, about to bring you into the world.

You sit quietly in the corner, unnoticed by everyone. The world hasn’t met you yet. You’re just a few breaths away from your very beginning.

Then, a sound. A cry. Your cry.

A nurse steps out and announces the birth. Your father freezes, then bursts into laughter, tears already welling up in his eyes. It’s not a grand moment for the world—but for them, it’s everything.

You watch, heart full, as your past begins. Not as a memory, but as a witness.

And as the pocket watch starts to hum again, gently pulling you back to your own time, you realize something: before you could change the world, it had already changed for you—on this very day.
