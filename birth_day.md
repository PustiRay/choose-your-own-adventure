You clutch the mysterious pocket watch tightly and whisper, “Take me to the day I was born.”

A jolt of energy surges through you, and in a blink, you're no longer in your college dorm. The world around you feels hazy and dreamlike, as if the air itself is tinted with nostalgia.

You find yourself in a quiet hospital room. Through the window, soft morning light filters in. The date on the wall calendar confirms it — this is your birthday. The *real* one.

You watch in awe as a younger version of your parents rushes in. They look anxious, excited, full of life and nerves. A nurse passes by you without a glance — it’s clear you’re invisible to everyone here.

On the bed lies your mother, holding a newborn — *you*. You’ve never felt this strange mixture of wonder and vulnerability before. The room feels sacred. You realize you’re not just witnessing a moment — you’re part of it, in a way only time travel allows.

You take a deep breath. For once, time isn't something to race against — it's something to marvel at.

As the pocket watch softly ticks in your hand, the scene fades.

You return to the present, forever changed by what you saw.
