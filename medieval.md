# Back in Time: The Medieval Era

You blink — hard. One second you were in your dorm room, and now you’re standing in the middle of a busy village square.

People around you are dressed in old-timey clothes. There’s a blacksmith hammering something super loud nearby, and a bunch of chickens just ran past your feet. It smells like fresh bread, dirt... and maybe horse poop?

You look down — your hoodie is gone. You’re wearing a long cloak and leather boots. What’s even weirder? No one seems surprised by you being here.

The pocket watch in your hand is glowing faintly, like it’s still working... but you have no idea how to use it again.

Just then, a royal guard approaches you. "You there!" he shouts. "The king requests your presence at the castle. Now."

You gulp.

Do you:

- Follow the guard and hope you’re not in trouble?  
- Run the other way and try to figure things out on your own?

Before you can decide, the guard grabs your arm — and your adventure truly begins.
